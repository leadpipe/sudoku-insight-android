  <li>When you share your anonymous data, the moves you make to solve puzzles
    become publicly available at sudoku-insight.appspot.com.  However, <b>no
    identifying information about you</b> is associated with those moves.

  <li>If you <b>set up an account</b>, then you can install Sudoku Insight on
    more than one device and be sure to get a different stream of puzzles on
    each one.  (You may get one or two repeated just after you set up the
    account on the new device.)  <b>Your account will only be used to coordinate
    among multiple installations of Sudoku Insight.</b>

  <li>Most Sudokus in the world are so-called <b>"proper,"</b> meaning they have
    just one solution.  If you're up for a challenge, let the app show you the
    occasional "improper" puzzle.
