<a name=symmetry><h2>Symmetries</h2></a>

The clues in a Sudoku are sometimes arranged in a symmetrical pattern, or close
to one.  These are the symmetries used and recognized by the app:
<ul>
  <li><b>classic</b>: the 180° rotational symmetry that most Sudokus exhibit.
    Clues come in pairs on opposite sides of the center square.

  <li><b>diagonal</b>: mirror symmetry across the main diagonal.

  <li><b>mirror</b>: mirror symmetry across the vertical axis.

  <li><b>double mirror</b>: mirror symmetries across the horizontal and vertical
    axes.

  <li><b>rotational</b>: 90° rotational symmetry.

  <li><b>blockwise</b>: each block's clues are in the same pattern as the 2
    other blocks diagonal to it.

  <li><b>none</b>: none of the above.

</ul>
