<h1>Solving Sudoku</h1>

<ul>
  <li><b>Learn the rules</b> of the game <a href="#rules">below</a>.

  <li><b>Enter a number</b> by touching the square, then sliding toward where
    that number would appear on a clock face.  For example, 3 is to the right
    &mdash; 3 o'clock.

  <li><b>Repeat the previous number</b> in a blank square by tapping the square.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
    <b>Undo a mistake</b> by tapping the <i>Undo</i> command.  Or simply enter
    the correct number.

  <li><b>Erase a number</b> by touching the square, then sliding toward 12 o'clock.

  <li><b>If you see this</b> <img src="trail-entry.png"> instead of this
    <img src="normal-entry.png"> when you enter a 1, you have <a href="#trails">
    started a trail</a> (see below).  To turn the trail display off, uncheck the
    trail's checkbox in the list below the grid.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_all_enabled.png">
    <b>Start over</b> using the <i>Undo to Start</i> command.  Tip: tap the
    <i>Redo</i> command repeatedly after starting over until you find the
    mistake.

  <li><b>If you get stuck,</b> try <a href="#trails">creating trails</a> (see
    below).  Or use the <i>Give Up</i> command from the menu, then
    <a href="info.html#review">review your attempt</a> to see what you missed.

</ul>

<a name=trails><h2>Trails</h2></a>
<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_trail_enabled.png">
    A <b>trail</b> is a series of moves that follow from an initial guess.
    The <i>New Trail</i> command starts one.

  <li><img class="float" src="trail-entry.png">A trail's moves are shown in a
    color and in one corner of their squares.

  <li>The purpose of a trail is to <b>disprove that initial guess.</b>  A
    productive trail follows the consequences of the first move all the way to a
    contradiction: a situation that breaks the rules of the game.

  <li>When you have disproved a guess, turn off the trail and make any moves
    that follow, given the new information.

  <li><b>To turn off a trail</b> entirely, uncheck its checkbox in the list
    below the solution grid.

  <li><b>To just turn off the trail's entry</b> but leave the trail showing,
    toggle the on/off button to the right of the trail list.

  <li>You may show <b>up to 4 trails</b> simultaneously.

  <li><b>To make an old trail active,</b> touch its row in the list somewhere
    other than its checkbox.

  <li><b>To gray out a trail</b> in the list, long-press its row.

</ul>

<a name=rules><h2>The Rules of Sudoku</h2></a>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fill in the blank squares</b> with numbers from 1 through 9.

  <li>A solved Sudoku has <b>all 9 numbers</b> in every row, column, and 3-by-3
    block of the board.

  <li>A good place to start is to look for a block where some number can only be
    in one of its squares.  Put the number in that square, then look for the
    next forced move.

    <img src="example1.png" class="example">

    For example, examine this puzzle.  In block 2 (top center), the number 1 can
    only be in its top right square.  In block 5 (center), 6 must be in the top
    left square.  In block 8 (bottom center), 3 must be in the top right square.

  <li>A row or column may likewise have just one possible open spot for a given
    number.  These are typically harder to see than block moves.  An example
    from the above puzzle is the number 7 in row 6: its only possible location
    is the center square.

  <li>There are several other ways to see that some number must go in some
    square.  The <a href="replay.html">Review</a> screen shows several of these
    &mdash; the only catch is, you have to either solve the puzzle first or give
    up.

</ul>
