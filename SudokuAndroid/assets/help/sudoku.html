<h1>Solving Sudoku</h1>

<ul>
  <li><b>Learn the rules</b> of the game <a href="#rules">below</a>.

  <li><b>Enter a number</b> by touching the square, then sliding in the
    "clock-face" direction of that number.  For example, 3 is to the right.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
    <b>Undo a mistake</b> using the <i>Undo</i> command.  Or simply enter the
    correct number.

  <li><b>Erase a number</b> by touching the square, then sliding toward 12 o'clock.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_all_enabled.png">
    <b>Start over</b> using the <i>Undo to Start</i> command.  Tip: use the Redo
    command repeatedly after starting over until you find the mistake.

  <li><b>If you get stuck,</b> try <a href="#trails">creating trails</a> (see
    below).  Or use the <i>Give Up</i> command from the menu, then
    <a href="info.html">review your attempt</a> to see what you missed.

</ul>
