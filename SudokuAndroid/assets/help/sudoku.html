<h1>Solving Sudoku</h1>

<ul>
  <li><b>Learn the rules</b> of the game <a href="#rules">below</a>.

  <li><b>Enter a number</b> by touching the square, then sliding toward where
    that number would appear on a clock face.  For example, 3 is to the right.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
    <b>Undo a mistake</b> using the <i>Undo</i> command.  Or simply enter the
    correct number.

  <li><b>Erase a number</b> by touching the square, then sliding toward 12 o'clock.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_all_enabled.png">
    <b>Start over</b> using the <i>Undo to Start</i> command.  Tip: use
    the <i>Redo</i> command repeatedly after starting over until you find the
    mistake.

  <li><b>If you get stuck,</b> try <a href="#trails">creating trails</a> (see
    below).  Or use the <i>Give Up</i> command from the menu, then
    <a href="info.html#review">review your attempt</a> to see what you missed.

</ul>

    A <b>trail</b> is a series of moves that follow from an initial guess.
    The <i>New Trail</i> command starts one.

<a name=rules><h2>The Rules of Sudoku</h2></a>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fill in the blank squares</b> with numbers from 1 through 9.

  <li>A solved Sudoku has <b>all 9 numbers</b> in every row, column, and 3-by-3
    block of the board.

  <li>A good place to start is to look for a block where some number can only be
    in one of its squares.  Put the number in that square, then look for the
    next forced move.

  <li>A row or column may likewise have just one possible open spot for a given
    number.  These are typically harder to see than block moves.

  <li>There are several other ways to see that some number must go in some
    square.  The <a href="replay.html">Review</a> screen shows several of these
    &mdash; the only catch is, you have to either solve the puzzle first or give
    up.
