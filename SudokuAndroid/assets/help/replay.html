<h1>Reviewing Puzzles</h1>

The review page replays the moves you made in a puzzle, showing you how each
move is implied or if it is in error.  You may also pause the replay at any
point, and then explore the moves implied at that point.

<h2>Playback</h2>
<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_pause_enabled.png">
    <i>Pause</i> stops playback, and starts calculating all the implied moves at
    the stopping point.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_reverse_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_play_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Reverse</i> and <i>Play</i> resume replaying your moves, backwards or
    forwards.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Undo</i> and <i>Redo</i> go backward or forward one move.

  <li><b>The slider</b> below these buttons lets you jump to any point in the
    playback.
</ul>

<h2>Exploration</h2>

When playback is paused, the app calculates insights implied by the current
state of the grid.  You can touch an outlined square to see the insights
associated with that square.

<ul>
  <li><b>Yellow/green outline</b>: an <i>assignment</i> is implied for that
    location.  Darker green means a shorter chain of insights leading to the
    assignment, lighter means a longer chain.  Yellow means the number of links
    hasn't been calculated yet.

  <li><b>Orange outline</b>: a <i>disproof</i> is available at that location.
    This is a proposed assignment to that location and the error that would
    result, with a chain of insights between them.
</ul>

During exploration, these actions are enabled:

<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_apply_enabled.png">
    <i>Apply</i> makes the selected assignment, or crosses out the disproved
    assignment.  Once you've applied one, every location you select
    automatically applies its insight.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_clear_enabled.png">
    <i>Clear</i> clears the insights from the grid.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_resume_enabled.png">
    <i>Resume</i> undoes any applied insights and resumes playing back your
    moves.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
      <img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Undo</i> and <i>Redo</i> also work while exploring.
</ul>
