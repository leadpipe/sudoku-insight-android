<h1>Puzzle Solution</h1>

The solution page replays the moves you made in a puzzle, showing you how each
move is implied or if it is in error.  You may also pause the replay at any
point, and then explore the moves implied at that point.

<h2>Playback</h2>
<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_pause_enabled.png">
    <i>Pause</i> stops playback, and starts calculating all the implied moves at
    the stopping point.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_reverse_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_play_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Reverse</i> and <i>Play</i> resume replaying your moves, backwards or
    forwards.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_jump_back_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_jump_forward_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Jump Back</i> and <i>Jump Forward</i> take you to the previous or next
    point in the playback where you switched trails.  These points are often the
    best places to see what you missed, and from which to start exploring.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Undo</i> and <i>Redo</i> go backward or forward one move.

  <li><b>The slider</b> below these buttons lets you jump to any point in the
    playback.
</ul>

<h2>Exploring the Solution</h2>

When playback is paused or complete, the app calculates moves implied by the
current state of the grid.  You can touch an outlined square to see the insights
associated with that square.  Once you've touched one, use the <i>Apply</i>
command to make the associated move and continue exploring.

<ul>
  <li><b>Yellow/green outline</b>: a move is implied for that location.  Darker
    green means a shorter chain of insights leading to the move, lighter means a
    longer chain.  Yellow means the number of links hasn't been calculated yet.

  <li><b>Purple/blue outline</b>: a <i>disproof</i> is available at that
    location.  This is a proposed move in that location and the error that would
    result, with a chain of insights between them.  Purple means the disproof
    leads to few or no subsequent moves; blue means it leads to many or all
    remaining squares having implied moves.
</ul>

In addition, these squares contain numbers that measure the insights:

<ul>
  <li><b>Number of steps</b> in the insight.  Smaller numbers usually mean that
    the insight is easier to see.

  <li><b>Coverage percentage</b> for disproofs, meaning the percentage of
    remaining unfilled squares that would have implied assignments if the
    disproof were applied.
</ul>

During exploration, these actions are enabled:

<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_apply_enabled.png">
    <i>Apply</i> makes the selected move, or crosses out the disproved move.
    Once you've applied one, every following move you select is automatically
    applied.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_clear_enabled.png">
    <i>Clear</i> clears the insights currently being shown.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_resume_enabled.png">
    <i>Resume</i> undoes any applied insights and resumes playing back your
    moves.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Undo</i> and <i>Redo</i> also work while exploring.
</ul>

<h2>Insights</h2>

These are the insights displayed in the grid, and what they mean.

<ul>
  <li><div class="float"><img src="forced-loc-1.png"> <img src="forced-loc-2.png"></div>
    <b>Forced-location assignment</b>: a numeral has only one possible location
    within a <i>unit</i> (block, row, or column).  Shown with a unit indicator:
    a square for the block, a line for the row or column.

  <li><img class="float" src="forced-num.png">
    <b>Forced-numeral assignment</b>: a location has only one possible numeral.
    Shown with all the other numerals' clock positions crossed out.

  <li><img class="float" src="overlap.png">
    <b>Overlap</b>: a numeral's only possible locations within a block all lie
    in a line, so that numeral can't appear elsewhere in the line.  Or vice
    versa.  Shown with the numeral in its clock position and the unit indicator
    of the unit whose choices are curtailed.

  <li><img class="float" src="locked-set.png">
    <b>Locked set</b>: a set of numerals is limited to a set of locations of the
    same size within a unit, so no other numerals can go in those locations and
    those numerals can't go in any other locations in the unit.  Shown with the
    unit indicator.

  <li><img class="float" src="conflict.png">
    <b>Conflict error</b>: the same numeral appears twice in a given unit.
    Shown with the offending numerals in red and the unit outlined in red.

  <li><img class="float" src="barred-loc.png">
    <b>Barred-location error</b>: a location is barred from having any numeral.
    All numerals' clock positions are crossed out, and the location is outlined
    in red.

  <li><img class="float" src="barred-num.png">
    <b>Barred-numeral error</b>: a numeral is barred from every location in a
    unit.  The numeral's clock position is crossed out in all of the unit's
    locations, and the unit is outlined in red.

  <li><img class="float" src="unfounded.png">
    <b>Unfounded assignment</b>: shown when an assignment has no basis in the
    insights the app understands, and shown for a disproof's initial assignment.
</ul>
