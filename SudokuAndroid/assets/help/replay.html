<h1>Reviewing Puzzles</h1>

The review page replays the moves you made in a puzzle, showing you how each
move is implied or if it is in error.  You may also pause the replay at any
point, and then explore the moves implied at that point.

<h2>Playback</h2>
<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_play_enabled.png">
    <b>Play</b> resumes replaying your moves.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_back_enabled.png">
    <b>Back</b> plays your moves backwards.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_pause_enabled.png">
    <b>Pause</b> stops playback, and starts calculating all the implied moves at
    the stopping point.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
    <b>Redo</b> goes forward one move.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
    <b>Undo</b> goes back one move.
</ul>
You may also jump to any point in the playback using the slider below these
buttons.

<h2>Exploration</h2>

When playback is paused, the moves implied by the current state of the grid are
calculated.  Squares with implied moves are outlined in green (for simple moves)
to yellow (for complicated moves or series of moves).
