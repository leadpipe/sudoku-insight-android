<h1>Reviewing Puzzles</h1>

The review page replays the moves you made in a puzzle, showing you how each
move is implied or if it is in error.  You may also pause the replay at any
point, and then explore the moves implied at that point.

<h2>Playback</h2>
<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_pause_enabled.png">
    <i>Pause</i> stops playback, and starts calculating all the implied moves at
    the stopping point.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_reverse_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_btn_play_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Reverse</i> and <i>Play</i> resume replaying your moves, backwards or
    forwards.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Undo</i> and <i>Redo</i> go backward or forward one move.

  <li><b>The slider</b> below these buttons lets you jump to any point in the
    playback.
</ul>

<h2>Exploration</h2>

When playback is paused, the app calculates insights implied by the current
state of the grid.  You can touch an outlined square to see the insights
associated with that square.

<ul>
  <li><b>Yellow/green outline</b>: an <i>assignment</i> is implied for that
    location.  Darker green means a shorter chain of insights leading to the
    assignment, lighter means a longer chain.  Yellow means the number of links
    hasn't been calculated yet.

  <li><b>Orange outline</b>: a <i>disproof</i> is available at that location.
    This is a proposed assignment to that location and the error that would
    result, with a chain of insights between them.
</ul>

During exploration, these actions are enabled:

<ul>
  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_apply_enabled.png">
    <i>Apply</i> makes the selected assignment, or crosses out the disproved
    assignment.  Once you've applied one, every assignment you select is
    automatically applied.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_clear_enabled.png">
    <i>Clear</i> clears the insights from the grid.

  <li><img class="float" src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_resume_enabled.png">
    <i>Resume</i> undoes any applied insights and resumes playing back your
    moves.

  <li><div class="float">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_undo_enabled.png">
      <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_menu_redo_enabled.png">
      </div>
    <i>Undo</i> and <i>Redo</i> also work while exploring.
</ul>

<h2>Insights</h2>

<ul>
  <li><div class="float"><img src="forced-loc-1.png"> <img src="forced-loc-2.png"></div>
    <b>Forced-location assignment</b>: a numeral has only one possible location
    within a <i>unit</i> (block, row, or column).  Shown with a unit indicator:
    a square for the block, a line for the row or column.

  <li><img class="float" src="forced-num.png">
    <b>Forced-numeral assignment</b>: a location has only one possible numeral.
    Shown with all the other numerals' clock positions crossed out.

  <li><img class="float" src="overlap.png">
    <b>Overlap</b>: a numeral's only possible locations within a block all lie
    in a line, so that numeral can't appear elsewhere in the line.  Or vice
    versa.  Shown with the numeral in its clock position and the unit indicator
    of the unit whose choices are curtailed.

  <li><img class="float" src="locked-set.png">
    <b>Locked set</b>: a set of numerals is limited to a set of locations of the
    same size within a unit, so no other numerals can go in those locations and
    those numerals can't go in any other locations in the unit.  Shown with the
    unit indicator.

  <li><img class="float" src="conflict.png">
    <b>Conflict error</b>: the same numeral appears twice in a given unit.
    Shown with the offending numerals in red and the unit outlined in red.

  <li><img class="float" src="barred-loc.png">
    <b>Barred-location error</b>: a location is barred from having any numeral.
    All numerals' clock positions are crossed out, and the location is outlined
    in red.

  <li><img class="float" src="barred-num.png">
    <b>Barred-numeral error</b>: a numeral is barred from every location in a
    unit.  The numeral's clock position is crossed out in all of the unit's
    locations, and the unit is outlined in red.

  <li><img class="float" src="unfounded.png">
    <b>Unfounded assignment</b>: shown when an assignment has no basis in the
    insights the app understands, and shown for a disproof's initial assignment.
</ul>
