</ul>

This app has had a lot of indirect help:
<ul>
  <li>The word "trail" came from Tom Sheldon and
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sudoku-Genius-Fiendish-Puzzles-Devised/dp/0452287502/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">his
    book of Sudokus</a>, which my wife bought for me years ago.

  <li>Peter Norvig's <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">brilliant Python
    code</a> for solving Sudoku informs a great deal of the core library behind
    this app.

  <li>I mined David Bau's Chrome extension
    <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/jssudoku/team">Heidi's Sudoku
      Hintpad</a> for ideas for the solver and the generator.

  <li>The icons in this app mostly come from an awesome site called
    <a href="http://thenounproject.com">The Noun Project</a>.  As per
    their <a href="http://thenounproject.com/using-symbols/#digital-attribution">attribution
    rules</a>, we list and link to the icons and their designers <a href="#icons">below</a>.

  <li>More validation for the trail approach, and for improper puzzles, came from
    J. F. Crook's <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200904/tx090400460p.pdf">AMS
    paper</a> (PDF).

</ul>
