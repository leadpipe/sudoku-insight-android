* Solver
** DONE Replace units & all strategies with various takes on locations
** DONE Generate stats, summarize, compare
** TODO Separate worklist processing from the iterator

* Generator
** TODO Investigate solving an empty grid: how slow can it get?

* App

* Math
** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
