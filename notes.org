** TODO Non-unique puzzles

* Hints
** TODO Figure out how to turn game histories into pattern times
** TODO Fix analyzer to not apply sets & overlaps until they're the cheapest insight available

** Getting games with history from a sqlite db into a tsv file:
sqlite3 db <<END
.mode tabs
.output games.tsv
select p.puzzle, g.history from puzzle p, game g where g.puzzleId = p._id and g.gameState >= 3;
END

* Game
** TODO Rename getState to... what?

* App
** TODO Use today's date as the seed for generating puzzles
   - Date as a number + a counter that resets every day
   - eg 20120615001
   - Use same seed for picking symmetry, and do it by shuffling all symmetries
     and walking the list to find the first one enabled.  This should maximize
     the amount of sharing of puzzles.
   - Ensure that everyone will get the same solution grid?
   - Or maybe not: ensure that everyone with different
     symmetry/generator/uniqueness gets different solution grid.
** TODO Decent list view
   - When played, elapsed time, collections belong to (clickable)
   - Collection info in header (or all)
   - Sorting options in action bar
   - Highlight current puzzle
   - Keep list current in tablet view
** TODO Single puzzle info view
** TODO Don't have short names on the menu
** TODO Improve the trail colors--there's too much repetition and the yellows are too hard to read
** TODO Make it possible to disable a trail: gray it out and move it to the bottom of the list
** TODO Change the tablet layouts to do game and single-puzzle info view
** TODO Improve new-trail icon
** TODO Make icons for launcher, home

** TODO Preference for non-unique puzzles
** TODO Handle completion of potentially non-unique puzzles
   - by asking whether it was unique

** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location (?)

* Site
** TODO Look into data backup
** TODO Figure out how and what to share

* Math
** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
