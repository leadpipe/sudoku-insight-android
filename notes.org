*** TODO Try removing most obvious correlations from InsightMeasurer
    - In particular: flb's with the same numeral as the previous move are often
      just piggybacked on the previous scan.  Removing them from the analysis
      should improve fit to Poisson distribution.  (Though it will probably cut
      the amount of data down by a large amount -- and so may not be useful as
      the source for timing numbers.)

** Getting games with history from a sqlite db into a tsv file:
sqlite3 phone-2012-07-08.db <<END
.mode tabs
.output games-phone-2012-07-08.tsv
select p.puzzle, g.history from puzzle p, game g where g.puzzleId = p._id and g.gameState >= 3;
END

** Bugs

** App/UI cleanups
*** TODO Add a navigation drawer?
*** TODO Do auto stream handling better
    - if the server sets the stream, explicitly skip queued puzzles from previous stream
    - have the server send a GCM message to the younger installations to change
      their streams, rather than changing the older installations
*** TODO bug: somehow wound up getting shown completed puzzles
    - each time I started the app it advanced 3-4 in the history
    - find and fix the bug; but also harden the fragment against future similar
      bugs, by _not_ updating the DB when it gets a complete attempt
    - no idea, but did try to make sure the fragment doesn't write these back to the db
    - ok, I may have an idea: it may be that the generation counter got reset somehow
*** TODO Look into sending crash info to the app engine
*** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location
*** TODO Make translation of symmetry names possible
*** TODO Change behavior of capture when we already have the puzzle
    - Include a link to the puzzle details

** Publishing the app

** Cross-installation work
*** TODO Add pref for whether to sync from other devices
    - dependent on selecting an account

** Replay cleanups
*** TODO Animate insight display
    - for complex implications, this could help the visualization
*** TODO Update screen shots?
*** TODO Redo in exploration mode?
*** TODO Wrong-numeral mistakes show without the error during single-step playback
    - the error appears while running forward
    - but maybe not when it's in a trail?
*** TODO Why does the first trail in puzzle 14 switch errors?
*** TODO Analysis getting cropped early when use the slider
    - Leftover thread interruption?
*** TODO Clearing the present insight should clear the selected location too
    - should it also clear the error displayed?
    - or possibly everything but the nub of the error?

** List view ideas
*** TODO Add a count to the list spinner: #puzzles in collection
*** TODO Handle the importing of collections of puzzles
    - Add an activity that's triggered by .sdm files
    - Change the way we set up new attempts: look for attempt-less puzzles and queue one
    - Still want to generate new puzzles: add a pref for how often to do this, as
      a number between 0 and 1 (probably with 4-5 discrete choices: never,
      occasionally, etc)
*** TODO Consider supporting other selection-based operations on the list: deletion, exporting


* How to release the android app
  - http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing.html
  - Bump the versionCode and versionName in the manifest
  - Turn off "Build Automatically" (this gets the DEBUG flag turned off in the released app)
  - http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#ExportWizard
  - File -> Export -> Android Application
  - Name it SudokuAndroid-x.y-suffix.apk
  - Run it using adb install -r xxx.apk (or adb -d install -r on a device)
  - When it's all working, publish, then bump versionCode and versionName to dev numbers for next release

* App engine app

** Push notifications to phone
   - Recommended puzzle
   - Other installation info updated

** The web app
   - sample puzzles?
   - stats? num puzzles? num installations? num users? rates of change?
   - for logged-in users, info about their stuff

* Math
** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
