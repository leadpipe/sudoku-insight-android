** TODO Non-unique puzzles

* Hints
** TODO Figure out how to turn game histories into pattern times
** TODO Fix analyzer to not apply sets & overlaps until they're the cheapest insight available

** Getting games with history from a sqlite db into a tsv file:
sqlite3 phone-2012-07-08.db <<END
.mode tabs
.output games-phone-2012-07-08.tsv
select p.puzzle, g.history from puzzle p, game g where g.puzzleId = p._id and g.gameState >= 3;
END

* Game
** TODO Rename getState to... what?

* App
** TODO Use today's date as the seed for generating puzzles
   - Hash the following things together for basic seed:
     - Today's date
     - A daily counter
     - The generator (symmetry preserving or not)
     - "Properness" flag (allows >1 solution or not)
     - An installation number (pref to get different puzzles on different devices)
   - Use this to shuffle all the symmetries
   - Choose the first symmetry in the shuffled list that's enabled
   - Add the symmetry to the hash
   - Use this as the seed for generating the puzzle
** TODO Improve list view
   - Collection info in header (or all)
   - Sorting options in action bar
   - Highlight current puzzle
   - Start with newest puzzles first
** TODO Change tablet views:
   - Game board is just itself, centered
   - List shows info fragment
** DONE Single puzzle info view
** TODO "Start playing" in info view
** TODO "Undo to start", "redo to end" menu items
** TODO Don't have short names on the menu
** TODO Kill the "generate a puzzle" item; have "next puzzle" generate one if needed
** TODO Finish adding "up" behavior to the activities
** TODO Improve the trail colors--there's too much repetition and the yellows are too hard to read
** TODO Make it possible to disable a trail: gray it out and move it to the bottom of the list
** TODO Improve new-trail icon
** TODO Make icons for launcher, home

** TODO Preference for non-unique puzzles
** TODO Handle completion of potentially non-unique puzzles
   - by asking whether it was unique

** TODO Add thumbs up/down optional vote on the puzzle at the end

** DONE Add walkthrough fragment/activity
** TODO Add filters for list and replay links

** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location (?)

* Site
** TODO Look into data backup
** TODO Figure out how and what to share

* Math
** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
