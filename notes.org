* Insights
** Evaluator
*** TODO Investigate recent puzzles
- categories: estimate way too high, way too low, high, low, close to perfect
- add columns for the pattern that the estimator found, and patterns matching actual move
*** TODO One more round needed [0/5]
- [ ] change to always simulate n times; add std dev to rating
- [ ] instead of playable boolean, have probability of playing
- [ ] refine def of "simply": some hidden sets are way too hard to see
- [ ] look into adding a third level of implication complexity
- [ ] look for commonalities in missed simply and complexly implied moves
*** TODO Investigate distribution of times for multiple puzzles generated from the same end state

** Getting games with history from a sqlite db into a tsv file:
sqlite3 phone-2013-12-01.db <<END
.mode tabs
.output games-phone-2013-12-01.tsv
select p.clues, a.history, p.rating from puzzle p, attempt a where a.puzzleId = p._id and a.attemptState = 3;
END

* Game
** TODO Rename getState to... what?

* App

** Bugs
*** TODO bug: 1:1:2013-11:191 showed up with a series of different ratings, ever increasing
- not just on the board, but in the list as well
*** DONE bug: 1:5:2013-12:57 failed to register a completion
- played it, finished it, reviewed it, backed out of the review page and the
  details page, and ended up back at the play page, ready to play it again
- backed out again; next time I started the app, the next puzzle showed.
- but the following time, 57 showed again, from scratch
- no remaining record of the initial play
**** I believe I understand what causes this (it's happened more than once):
- I think we start with 2 SudokuActivities.  When we've finished the puzzle and
  backed out, we've completed just one of them; the other one is waiting to be
  resumed, and does resume when it gets control.
- Why does this happen?  I assume it's an Android bug.
- How to mitigate?  Not sure, but I bet it's possible.
**** singleTop should do the trick

** App/UI cleanups
*** TODO Show rating overlay on resume instead of just diving back into the puzzle
- need alternate button names
*** TODO Add a way to import a collection of puzzles: .sdm file [2/3]
- [X] basic implementation
- [X] add progress, and disable the button while saving to db
- [ ] ensure rating service will rate them all, before historical ones
*** TODO Add a help link after "Improper"
- use scheme filter idea
*** TODO Show collection name(s) in the rating view when there's no name
*** TODO Fix the list fragment so it maintains current scroll on update
- currently jumps back to selected item, not always what you want (in
  particular, not when stats or rating has been updated, or on resume)
*** TODO Don't send skipped puzzles to the app engine
- treat skipped puzzles specially, if we play them we should be changing the
  existing attempt not making a new one
- or at least treating the real attempt as the first attempt
*** TODO Update help
- acknowledge that the replay view can't handle all puzzles
- have the welcome dialog actually be a help page
  - show (part of) it for upgraders as well as newcomers
*** TODO Do auto stream handling better
- if the server sets the stream, explicitly skip queued puzzles from previous stream
- have the server send a GCM message to the younger installations to change
  their streams, rather than changing the older installations
*** TODO bug: somehow wound up getting shown completed puzzles
- each time I started the app it advanced 3-4 in the history
- find and fix the bug; but also harden the fragment against future similar
  bugs, by _not_ updating the DB when it gets a complete attempt
- no idea, but did try to make sure the fragment doesn't write these back to the db
- ok, I may have an idea: it may be that the generation counter got reset somehow
*** TODO Look into sending crash info to the app engine
*** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location
*** TODO Make translation of symmetry names possible
*** TODO Change behavior of capture when we already have the puzzle
- Include a link to the puzzle details
- Or just jump there?

** Publishing the app

** Cross-installation work
*** TODO Add pref for whether to sync from other devices
- dependent on selecting an account

** Replay cleanups
*** TODO Do something when asked to replay a puzzle that's impervious to breadth-first solving
*** TODO Handle improper puzzles' last moves
*** TODO Animate insight display
- for complex implications, this could help the visualization
*** TODO Update screen shots?
*** TODO Redo in exploration mode?
*** TODO Wrong-numeral mistakes show without the error during single-step playback
- the error appears while running forward
- but maybe not when it's in a trail?
*** TODO Why does the first trail in puzzle 14 switch errors?
*** TODO Analysis getting cropped early when use the slider
- Leftover thread interruption?
*** TODO Clearing the present insight should clear the selected location too
- should it also clear the error displayed?
- or possibly everything but the nub of the error?

** List view ideas
*** TODO Add a count to the list spinner: #puzzles in collection
*** TODO Handle the importing of collections of puzzles
- Add an activity that's triggered by .sdm files
- Change the way we set up new attempts: look for attempt-less puzzles and queue one
- Still want to generate new puzzles: add a pref for how often to do this, as a
  number between 0 and 1 (probably with 4-5 discrete choices: never,
  occasionally, etc)
*** TODO Consider supporting other selection-based operations on the list: deletion, exporting


* How to release the android app
- http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing.html
- Bump the versionCode and versionName in the manifest
- Turn off "Build Automatically" (this gets the DEBUG flag turned off in the released app)
- http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#ExportWizard
- File -> Export -> Android Application
- Name it SudokuAndroid-x.y-suffix.apk
- Run it using adb install -r xxx.apk (or adb -d install -r on a device)
- When it's all working, publish, then bump versionCode and versionName to dev numbers for next release

* App engine app

** Push notifications to phone
- Recommended puzzle
- Other installation info updated

** The web app
- sample puzzles?
- stats? num puzzles? num installations? num users? rates of change?
- for logged-in users, info about their stuff

* Math
** Pathological grids
- How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
- How to compare two grids for equivalence?
- Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
  - transposition
    - permutation of numerals
    - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
    - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
    - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
- Canonical grid?
