** TODO Non-unique puzzles

* Hints
** TODO Figure out how to turn game histories into pattern times
** TODO Fix analyzer to not apply sets & overlaps until they're the cheapest insight available

** Getting games with history from a sqlite db into a tsv file:
sqlite3 phone-2012-07-08.db <<END
.mode tabs
.output games-phone-2012-07-08.tsv
select p.puzzle, g.history from puzzle p, game g where g.puzzleId = p._id and g.gameState >= 3;
END

* Game
** TODO Rename getState to... what?

* App
** TODO Use today's date as the seed for generating puzzles
   - Hash the following things together for basic seed:
     - Today's date
     - A daily counter
     - The generator (symmetry preserving or not)
     - "Properness" flag (allows >1 solution or not)
     - An installation number (pref to get different puzzles on different devices)
   - Use this to shuffle all the symmetries
   - Choose the first symmetry in the shuffled list that's enabled
   - Add the symmetry to the hash
   - Use this as the seed for generating the puzzle
** DONE Implement replay activity (rudimentary)
** TODO Show insights during replay (rudimentary)
** TODO Add "give up" action / kill "next puzzle" action
** TODO Show number of set locations next to each trail
** TODO Improve the trail colors--there's too much repetition and the yellows are too hard to read
   - Make a new app to experiment with this
** DONE Handle clicking on a link referring to a list
** TODO Figure out why the progress indicator stops
   - Damn guava splitter static initialization is one reason
   - But can't be the only thing, or probably even the main one
** TODO Add a count to the list spinner: #puzzles in collection
** TODO Handle the importing of collections of puzzles
   - Add an activity that's triggered by .sdm files
   - Change the way we set up new games: look for game-less puzzles and queue one
   - Still want to generate new puzzles: add a pref for how often to do this, as
     a number between 0 and 1 (probably with 4-5 discrete choices: never,
     occasionally, etc)
** TODO Add voting on (solved) puzzles: +1 or -1 (or 0).  Show dialog on solve, allow update from info page.
** TODO Add common menu items (like prefs) to various activities
** TODO Figure out how to add "up" behavior to other activities
** TODO Make it possible to disable a trail: gray it out and move it to the bottom of the list
** TODO Improve new-trail icon
** TODO Make icons for launcher, home

** TODO Revamp prefs page to use ICS stuff

** TODO Preference for non-unique puzzles
** TODO Handle completion of potentially non-unique puzzles
   - by asking whether it was unique

** DONE Add filters for list and replay links

** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location

** TODO Consider supporting other selection-based operations on the list: deletion, exporting
** Possible list view tweaks
   - Collection info (or all) in header?
   - Remember last collection?
   - Filtering?

* Site
** TODO Look into data backup
** TODO Figure out how and what to share

* Math
** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
