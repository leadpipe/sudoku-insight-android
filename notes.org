* Solver

* Generator
** TODO What about non-unique puzzles?

* Hints
** DONE Add non-recursive assignment to Marks
** TODO Add LocSet?
** TODO Start work on basic visual strategies

** Kinds of insight
   - illegal move/impossible state
     - direct conflict: paint conflicting numbers in red?
     - empty set for possible assignments: highlight location or unit & numeral?
   - single possible numeral for location or location for unit & numeral
     - block & numeral: easiest to see
     - row/column & numeral: next
     - location: hardest
   - locked sets: naked/hidden sets: draw each set in its own color, show the
     numerals in each location with missing numerals crossed out
   - intersection reduction as a lead-in to an implied assignment: outline unit
     where the numeral is limited, highlighting squares where the numeral could
     be, ...

* Game
** TODO Make undo stack able to be saved/restored
** TODO Rename getState to getSolution or getSolutionState

* App
** DONE Make an action bar, move controls there
** DONE Have solution/trail button just be ON/OFF
** DONE Figure out how to change the theme: use a white one
** TODO Have grid vary display based on solution/trail input state
** TODO Change yellow dot to bold numeral for trailhead
** TODO Improve new-trail icon
** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location
** TODO Design the whole app, with fragments
** TODO Make icons for launcher, home
** TODO Manage game suspension/resumption from activity
** TODO Add timer display
** TODO Have separate view to show while generating puzzles, button to start playing
** TODO Tweak the trail colors so they're excellent with a white background
** TODO Make database for game state
** TODO Deal with the app lifecycle
   - onPause: save to db
   - need to save undo state as well
** TODO Look into data backup

** Fragments
   - The board: solve a puzzle
     - show hints
   - Review your solution
   - Choose a puzzle to solve
     - from a curated set
     - from a generator
     - from puzzles I solved in the past
     - from puzzles I'm partway through
   - Enter a puzzle
   - Rate a puzzle?


* Math
** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
