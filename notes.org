** TODO Figure out how to turn game histories into pattern times
** TODO Fix analyzer to not apply sets & overlaps until they're the cheapest insight available

** Getting games with history from a sqlite db into a tsv file:
sqlite3 phone-2012-07-08.db <<END
.mode tabs
.output games-phone-2012-07-08.tsv
select p.puzzle, g.history from puzzle p, game g where g.puzzleId = p._id and g.gameState >= 3;

** TODO Rename getState to... what?

* App
** TODO Kill the prefs for individual symmetries: just use them all
** TODO Use "None" as the name for the Random symmetry (when applicable)
** TODO Use today's date as the seed for generating puzzles
   - Hash the following things together for basic seed:
     - Today's date
     - A daily counter per symmetry
     - The generator (symmetry preserving or not)
     - "Properness" flag (allows >1 solution or not)
     - An installation number (pref to get different puzzles on different devices)
       - This solution to this problem sucks
       - Another not-very-good solution: call to a central server
         - works, except when (say) on an airplane, the place you're most likely
           to want to use multiple devices
       - How about checking in with the central server periodically, and having
         it keep track of the devices, and assigning each one a number mod
         device count; each one would then generate every nth puzzle, offset
         - I think this is the best approach.  It also gives us a jumping off
           point for recommendations, and for gathering stats on puzzles
   - Use this to shuffle all the symmetries
     - (if they're all enabled, no need for this step)
   - Choose the first symmetry in the shuffled list that's enabled
   - Add the symmetry to the hash
   - Use this as the seed for generating the puzzle
   - Use json notation for the generator params
   - Possibly add a name that summarizes all of this
** TODO Use backup service to keep basic prefs, like generation params
** TODO Write an appengine app that gathers data from the android app
   - use GUID to identify the installation
   - allow login using Google ID to keep different installations from generating the same puzzles
   - will android tell us which Google ID installed the app?
   - when the app is slightly off the ground, sign up for Cloud Endpoints at http://endpoints-trusted-tester.appspot.com/
** TODO Automatically pause the replay on switch of trail, just after the move
** DONE Display of insights
   - when running forward, display the insight found for the latest move, plus
     the error that resulted from it.  If no insight is found, show an unfounded
     assignment.
   - when running backward, don't look for insights
   - when paused, display the insights that would be applied on tap
** DONE When targeting an assignment to an occupied location, remove that location from the search starting point
** DONE Bug: errors not shown after analysis complete (when not running)
** TODO Bug: analysis not being interrupted
** DONE Bug: pausing takes an extra step
** DONE Bug: restarting main activity loses uninterestingness of trails
** DONE Bug: disproof markers being shown during forward run
** DONE Bug: double-time reverse run sometimes
** DONE Bug: disproofs being shown for size > 2 while there are size = 2 ones showing
** TODO Make replay view rotate properly
   - including not losing track of where it is
** DONE Consider a second progress view for the secondary replay background tasks
** DONE Investigate turning the progress view on while running replay and analysis runs long
** TODO Make replay view sized reasonably for tablet
** TODO Think about animation of insight display
   - for complex implications, this could help the visualization
** DONE Fix activity transitions when you're done with a puzzle
   - Also, go to the list activity.  If it doesn't have an info fragment, make it open the info activity.
** TODO Fix capture activity for manual entry
   - "you already have this" always shown as you're entering numerals
** TODO Figure out why the progress indicator stops
   - Damn guava splitter static initialization is one reason
   - But can't be the only thing, or probably even the main one
   - Remove stuff from the foreground thread to figure this out
   - Hmm, doesn't appear to be my stuff?  Build a release version and see if it still happens.
** TODO Add a count to the list spinner: #puzzles in collection
** TODO Handle the importing of collections of puzzles
   - Add an activity that's triggered by .sdm files
   - Change the way we set up new games: look for game-less puzzles and queue one
   - Still want to generate new puzzles: add a pref for how often to do this, as
     a number between 0 and 1 (probably with 4-5 discrete choices: never,
     occasionally, etc)
** TODO Add common menu items (like prefs) to various activities
** TODO Figure out how to add "up" behavior to other activities
** TODO Improve new-trail icon
** TODO Make icons for launcher, home

** TODO Revamp prefs page to use ICS stuff

** TODO Preference for non-unique puzzles
** TODO Handle completion of potentially non-unique puzzles
   - by asking whether it was unique

** TODO Give visual indication when try to set an unsettable location

** TODO Consider supporting other selection-based operations on the list: deletion, exporting
** Possible list view tweaks
   - Collection info (or all) in header?
   - Remember last collection?
   - Filtering?

** TODO Look into data backup
** TODO Figure out how and what to share

** Pathological grids
   - How bad can they get?
*** TODO Solve one in the debugger, see what's going on

** Canonical grids
   - How to compare two grids for equivalence?
   - Possible permutations that preserve constraints:
     - transposition
     - permutation of numerals
     - permutation of block-rows or block-columns
     - permutation of rows within a block-row or columns within a block-column
     - rotation (can it be expressed by the others? -- yes)
*** TODO Re-read the "how many sudokus" paper
    - Canonical grid?
