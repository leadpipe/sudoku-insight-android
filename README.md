# Sudoku Insight

Sudoku Insight is an Android app for solving Sudoku puzzles.

It generates an infinite stream of puzzles, of widely varying difficulty.  When
you have completed a puzzle, or given up on it, the app lets you explore the
solution and shows you insights about the puzzle that you might have missed.

This repository also contains the code for the server side portion of the app,
which saves the list of moves made for each attempt to solve a puzzle.

## Privacy Policy

The Sudoku Insight app allows you to link the app to an Android account.  The
only purpose for this linking is to make it possible for the app to
automatically keep the stream of puzzles generated on one device different from
those generated on a different device, if both installations are linked to the
same account.  The app does not force you to link an account, and your account
ID is not used for anything other than this automatic establishment of different
puzzle streams.

It is also possible to manually choose puzzle streams for each installation, and
thereby get the guaranteed different puzzles on different devices without
divulging your account ID.
